# Overview

Galileo utilises ![MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build its documentaton, with the source for this documentation located under the "docs" directory in the repository root. There is a development build task provided ("pnpm docs:serve") that launches a local documentation server at http://127.0.0.1:8000. This local server monitors for documentation source file modifications, which automatically generates and reloads published content.
