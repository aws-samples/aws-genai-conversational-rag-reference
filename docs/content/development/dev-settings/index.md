# Dev Settings

--8<-- "development/dev-settings/_/header.md"

The **Dev Settings** is designed to support rapid development iterations without requiring a deployment, including integrating with models deployed outside the application. The aim is to support trying out the latest models against the full application flow before committing to codifying and deploying the models from within the application, such as testing a new model deployed from [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models.html){:target="_blank"}.

Cognito uses added to the **Administrators** group will see the **Dev Settings** panel rendered on the bottom of the *Chat* page.

    This enables the **Reset :material-reload:** action to reset from previously persisted config rather than default.

- **Copy :octicons-download-16:**: Copies the current config JSON to clipboard
- **Paste :octicons-upload-16:**: Overwrite current config with JSON from clipboard
- **Reset :material-reload:**: Replaces config with stored (*if available*) or default value
- **Clear :octicons-trash-16:**: Deletes stored value and resets to default value

!!! tip "Sharing Configs"

    To share configurations with other members of your team, or yourself, use the **Copy :octicons-download-16:**
    action to copy the current JSON configuration to the clipboard and send to otherwise.

    If running a workshop, you can also create a shared document with a list of configurations copied from the dev settings.
    Enabling other users to quickly copy and paste the same configuration with ease.
