!!! info "Scope & Persistence"

    Dev settings are scoped to the active **chat session** and currently only persisted locally via [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage){:target="_blank"} in the browser. Configurations are persisted anytime the chat session is changed or dev settings panel is closed.
