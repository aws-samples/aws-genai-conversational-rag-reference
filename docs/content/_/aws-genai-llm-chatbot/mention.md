    If you looking to benchmark multiple LLMs and RAG engines in a simple way, you should checkout [aws-samples/aws-genai-llm-chatbot](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genai-llm-chatbot). That project focuses more on experimentation with models and vector stores, while this project focuses more on building an extendable 3-tier application. In the future, we will look at bringing similar functionality into this project, and visa-versa, as we all navigate this rapidly evolving emerging technology landscape.
