# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

*Development Environment:*

|   Tool                |   Version   |    Recommendation            |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| pnpm                  | >=8.x       | <https://pnpm.io/installation> |
| NodeJS                | >=18        | Use Node Version Manager ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) |
| Python                | >=3.10,<4   | Use Python Version Manager ([pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)) |
| Poetry                | >=1.5,<2    | <https://python-poetry.org/docs/> |
| AWS CLI               | v2          | <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html> |
| Docker[^1] | v20+     | <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/> |
| JDK                   | v17+        | [Amazon Corretto 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html) |

[^1]: Docker virtual disk space should have at least 30GB of free space. If you see `no space left on device` error during build, free up space by running `docker system prune -f` and/or increasing the virtual disk size.

### AWS Service Quotas

Ensure the necessary service quota limits are increased *based on your configuration* before deploying. The deployment performs a check and will fail early if limits are not met.

!!! warning "Minimum Service Quota Requirements"
    The embedding model usage is required for all deployments at this time, and must be 5 unless configured different in the code.

    SageMaker processing job quota [ml.g4dn.2xlarge for processing job usage](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/sagemaker/quotas) must be `>= 5`. This is required for current bulk processing of dataset into vectorstore.

For predefined models, check the instance type from the follow table to determine the quota limits you need to increase.

??? abstract "Predefined Model"
    --8<-- "development/models/predefined-models.md"

Example, if you only deploy the *Falcon Lite* predefined model, then you only need to ensure `ml.g5.12xlarge for endpoint usage >= 1`, while the other quotas of *X for endpoint usage* can remain 0. With the exception of below minimum requirements.

!!! tip "Cross-Region Deployments"
    Galileo CLI enables you to deploy your LLM stack and application stack into different regions.

## Quick Start

!!! tip "Bedrock Model access"
    --8<-- "development/models/bedrock-models.md"

Quickly deploy the full solution using the following:

> * Make sure docker is running! And with sufficient virtual disk space.
> * Make sure your AWS credentials are setup and available in the shell.

### CLI

!!! tip "Recommended basic development for individuals, developer account, trials, and demos"

Use the companion cli for deploying the cdk infra

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run galileo-cli
# Follow the prompt from the cli to build and deploy what you want
```

The cli will generate an application configuration file in demo/infra/config.json, which will persist your configuration. You can modify this file and redeploy to change the configuration, or use the cli again.

> `pnpm run galileo-cli --help` for cli help info

### Manually

!!! tip "Recommended for full control and modification"

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build

cd demo/infra
pnpm exec cdk deploy --app cdk.out --require-approval never Dev/Galileo
pnpm exec cdk deploy --app cdk.out --require-approval never Dev/Galileo-SampleDataset # (optional)
```

### CI/CD pipeline

!!! tip "Recommended for live services and for shared team accounts"

1. Create a CodeCommit repository in your target account/region name "galileo"
1. Push this git repository to the `mainline` branch
1. Run `pnpm run deploy:pipeline`

> Make sure your AWS credentials in your shell are correct

## Using Cloud9 as your Galileo Development Environment

In your Galileo development account:

* Cloud9 → Create Environment
* New EC2 Instance → m5.large + Ubuntu 22.04 + 4h Timeout + AWS Systems Manager
* Open Cloud 9 IDE for this new environment
* Follow the resize instructions at <https://ec2spotworkshops.com/ecs-spot-capacity-providers/workshopsetup/resize_ebs.html>, giving your instance EBS volume 300GB (followed by a reboot)

In the Cloud9 instance shell, install some prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
nvm install lts/iron
nvm use lts/iron
npm i -g pnpm
wget -O- https://apt.corretto.aws/corretto.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://apt.corretto.aws stable main'
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y java-18-amazon-corretto-jdk

sudo apt install -y python3.11
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.10 110
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.11 100
# NOTE: select python3.11 from the list
sudo update-alternatives --config python3
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
